# API Audit Report

## Executive Summary

Documentation and implementation are aligned. The repository now exposes a single `/memories` surface (store, fetch, search, delete) and the documentation exclusively reflects that contract. All legacy references to `/store`, `/recall`, graph routes, and batch APIs have been removed.

## Endpoint Alignment

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `POST /memories` | ✅ Documented in Development Manual (API reference) and User Manual (storage guide). |
| `GET /memories/{coord}` | ✅ Documented with retrieval examples and CLI equivalents. |
| `DELETE /memories/{coord}` | ✅ Documented alongside lifecycle guides. |
| `POST /memories/search` | ✅ Documented with filter examples and CLI usage. |
| `GET /memories/search` | ✅ Documented as lightweight query-parameter variant. |
| Operational probes (`/stats`, `/health*`, `/metrics`, `/`, `/ping`) | ✅ Documented in Technical Manual (deployment + monitoring). |

## Documentation Completeness

- **Structure**: Docs rebuilt to match the mandated four-manual layout (User, Technical, Development, Onboarding) with no extra files.
- **Content**: Tutorials, feature guides, and runbooks use only `/memories` examples. CLI documentation mirrors the updated command set (`store`, `search`, `get`, `delete`).
- **Security & Ops**: Secrets policy, RBAC matrix, monitoring, and runbooks now reference the simplified contract and public probe set.

## Testing & Validation

- Ran `scripts/smoke.sh` to exercise `store → search → get → delete` flow.
- Manual `curl` verification confirmed `/store` and `/recall` return `404`.
- MkDocs build succeeds with the new structure (`mkdocs build`).

## Follow-Up Actions

| Priority | Action | Owner |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Medium | Continue pruning unused graph helper utilities from `core.py` in a future release. | Core Engineering |
| Low | Automate quarterly documentation audits via `scripts/audit-docs.py`. | Platform Docs |

## Appendix

### Request / Response Schemas

See `docs/development-manual/api-reference.md` for the authoritative JSON schemas. The OpenAPI spec generated by FastAPI is now in sync with the manuals.

### Token & Rate Limiting Configuration

Documented in `docs/technical-manual/deployment.md` and `docs/technical-manual/security/secrets-policy.md`. Rate limiting guidance reflects the single global limiter.
