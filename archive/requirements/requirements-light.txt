"""Archived generated requirements-light.txt â€” moved during cleanup.

This file was a generated pip-style requirements file. The canonical
source in this repository is the YAML manifest(s) (e.g. `requirements.yaml`,
`requirements-min.yaml`) plus `scripts/generate_requirements.py` which
converts YAML -> requirements.txt during CI/Docker builds.
