# Quick‑Start Guide

This guide shows the minimal steps to store and retrieve a memory using the HTTP API.

## 1. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose --profile core up -d
```

The API will be reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:10101`.

## 2. Set the dev token

```bash
export SOMA_API_TOKEN=devtoken
```

## 3. Store a memory

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10101/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOMA_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"coord":"1.0,2.0,3.0","payload":{"message":"Hello"},"memory_type":"semantic"}'
```

You should receive a `200` response with the stored memory ID.

## 4. Retrieve the memory by coordinate

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:10101/memories/1.0,2.0,3.0 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOMA_API_TOKEN"
```

## 5. Search by query

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10101/memories/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOMA_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Hello","top_k":5}'
```

The response contains the most similar memories.
