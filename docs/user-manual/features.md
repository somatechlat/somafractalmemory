# Features Overview

This document provides a high‑level overview of the capabilities offered by **SomaFractalMemory**.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Episodic Memory** | Store arbitrary JSON payloads indexed by a coordinate vector. Retrieval by exact coordinate.
| **Semantic Memory** | Store payloads with vector embeddings (via Qdrant) enabling similarity search.
| **Graph Store** | Relationships between memories are captured in a NetworkX graph for traversals and reasoning.
| **Versioning** | Each memory version is retained, allowing rollback and audit trails.
| **Bulk Operations** | Batch insert and delete APIs for high‑throughput ingestion.
| **Health & Metrics** | `/healthz`, `/readyz` endpoints and Prometheus‑compatible metrics.
| **Extensible Provider Architecture** | Plug‑in new KV, vector, or graph back‑ends by implementing the provider interfaces.

## Non‑Functional Characteristics

* **Scalable** – Horizontal scaling via Docker Compose; each component can be replaced with a managed cloud service.
* **Secure** – Token‑based authentication, TLS termination can be added via a reverse proxy.
* **Observability** – Structured logging, OpenTelemetry traces (optional).
* **Compliance** – Documentation follows ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility.
