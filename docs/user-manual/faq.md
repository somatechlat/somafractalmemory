# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ addresses the most common questions users have when getting started with **SomaFractalMemory**.

## General

**Q: What is the difference between *episodic* and *semantic* memory?**
A: *Episodic* memory stores the payload exactly as‑provided and is retrieved by the exact coordinate key. *Semantic* memory also stores the payload but creates a vector embedding (via Qdrant) that enables similarity search based on content.

**Q: Do I need Docker to run the system?**
A: Docker is required for the supporting services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant). The API itself is a pure Python FastAPI app and can be run locally without Docker if you provide alternative back‑ends.

## Authentication & Security

**Q: How is authentication handled?**
A: The API expects a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. For local development a static token (`devtoken`) is used. In production you should provision a secure token and rotate it regularly.

**Q: Can I run the API behind a TLS reverse proxy?**
A: Yes. The API does not terminate TLS itself; you can place an Nginx or Traefik proxy in front of it.

## Operations

**Q: How do I delete a memory?**
A: Use the `DELETE /memories/{coord}` endpoint. This removes the entry from the KV store, vector store, and graph store.

**Q: How can I bulk‑load many memories?**
A: The `POST /memories/bulk` endpoint accepts a JSON array of memory objects for efficient ingestion.

## Development

**Q: Where can I find the API OpenAPI schema?**
A: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:10101/openapi.json` when the server is running.

**Q: How do I run the test suite?**
A: Inside the virtual environment run `pytest -q`. Linting with `ruff check .` and type checking with `mypy somafractalmemory` are also recommended.
