# Soma Fractal Memory Documentation

Welcome to the documentation portal for **SomaFractalMemory (SFM)**. This site mirrors the repository state and links directly to the configuration, architecture, and API references you will use in day-to-day development.

- **Need the full project overview?** See the `README.md` in the repository root for the canonical introduction, architecture diagram, and installation instructions.
- **Ready to dive in?** Start with the [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) to spin up the stack and store your first memories.
- **Looking for deeper context?** Use the navigation bar to jump to architecture notes, configuration references, operational runbooks, and the API surface.

All pages are generated from the checked-in Markdown filesâ€”no manual steps are required beyond keeping the docs up to date when code changes. If you spot discrepancies, update both the documentation and the relevant code/tests in the same change.
