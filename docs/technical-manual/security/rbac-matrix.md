# Security Controls and RBAC Matrix

## Overview
This document defines the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies and security controls for SomaFractalMemory components.

## RBAC Matrix

### API Roles

| Role | Description | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `admin` | System administrator | All operations | System management |
| `reader` | Read-only access | GET operations | Data analysis |
| `writer` | Write access | GET, POST, PUT | Data ingestion |
| `service` | Service account | Specific APIs | Inter-service communication |

### Kubernetes RBAC

| ServiceAccount | Namespace | Role | Purpose |
|---------------|-----------|------|---------|
| `memory-service` | `memory` | `memory-service-role` | Core service operations |
| `vector-store` | `memory` | `qdrant-operator` | Vector store management |
| `monitoring` | `monitoring` | `prometheus-role` | Metrics collection |

## Security Controls

### Authentication
1. API Token Authentication
   - JWT-based tokens
   - Token expiration: 24 hours
   - Refresh mechanism available

2. Service-to-Service Auth
   - Mutual TLS (mTLS)
   - Service account tokens

### Authorization
1. API Endpoints
   - Role-based middleware
   - Scope validation
   - Rate limiting

2. Storage Access
   - Encrypted credentials
   - Connection pooling
   - Read/write segregation

### Data Protection
1. At Rest
   - Database encryption
   - Volume encryption
   - Backup encryption

2. In Transit
   - TLS 1.3
   - mTLS for services
   - Certificate rotation

## Compliance Requirements

### Data Classification
| Type | Classification | Controls |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Memory vectors | Internal | Encryption at rest |
| User metadata | Confidential | Encryption + Access logs |
| System logs | Internal | Retention policy |

### Audit Requirements
- Access logs retention: 90 days
- Security events: 1 year
- Configuration changes: 1 year

## Security Monitoring

### Critical Alerts
1. Authentication failures
2. Unauthorized access attempts
3. Configuration changes
4. Encryption failures

### Audit Logs
- Location: `/var/log/memory-service/audit.log`
- Format: JSON
- Fields: timestamp, actor, action, resource, result

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
1. Unauthorized access
2. Data breach
3. Service compromise

### Response Procedure
1. Detect and isolate
2. Assess impact
3. Contain and mitigate
4. Document and report
5. Post-mortem review
