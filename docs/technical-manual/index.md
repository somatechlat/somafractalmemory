# Technical Manual

This manual is for SREs, platform engineers, and operators responsible for deploying and running SomaFractalMemory. It documents:

- Reference architecture and dependency graph.
- Deployment procedures for Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
- Monitoring, alerting, and operational runbooks.
- Backup, disaster recovery, and security practices.

Every section reflects the simplified `/memories` API introduced in version 2.0.0. All runbooks, diagrams, and playbooks have been purged of legacy `/store`/`/recall` references.
