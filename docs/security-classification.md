# Security Classification

This document defines the classification levels applied to the **SomaFractalMemory** codebase and documentation.

| Asset | Classification | Reason |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Source Code | **Internal** | Business logic, but no secret algorithms.
| API Tokens (dev) | **Public‑Safe** | Used only for local development; not suitable for production.
| Production Secrets | **Confidential** | Database passwords, JWT secret keys – must be stored in a secret manager.
| Documentation | **Internal** | Contains architecture details; not public‑facing.

All contributors must treat **Confidential** assets with appropriate safeguards (encrypted storage, limited access).
