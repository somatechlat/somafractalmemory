# Graph Theory in Memory Systems

## Overview
Graph theory provides the foundation for representing relationships between memories in SomaFractalMemory.

## Core Concepts

### Graph Structure
```python
class MemoryGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}  # coordinate -> node
        self.edges = {}  # (from_coord, to_coord) -> edge

    def add_edge(self, from_coord, to_coord, weight=1.0):
        """Add a weighted edge between memories"""
        self.edges[(from_coord, to_coord)] = {
            'weight': weight,
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        }
```

### Node Properties
- Coordinate (vector)
- Metadata
- Access count

### Edge Properties
- Weight
- Type
- Timestamp

## Graph Operations

### Path Finding
```python
def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    """Find shortest path between memories"""
    distances = {start: 0}
    path = {start: [start]}
    nodes = set(graph.nodes.keys())

    while nodes:
        min_node = None
        for node in nodes:
            if node in distances:
                if min_node is None:
                    min_node = node
                elif distances[node] < distances[min_node]:
                    min_node = node

        if min_node is None:
            break

        nodes.remove(min_node)
        current_weight = distances[min_node]

        for edge in graph.get_edges(min_node):
            weight = current_weight + edge['weight']
            if edge['to'] not in distances or weight < distances[edge['to']]:
                distances[edge['to']] = weight
                path[edge['to']] = path[min_node] + [edge['to']]

    return path.get(end)
```

## Memory Relationships

### Types of Relationships
1. Causal
2. Temporal
3. Spatial
4. Semantic

### Weight Management
```python
def update_edge_weight(edge, factor):
    """Update edge weight based on usage"""
    edge['weight'] *= factor
    edge['access_count'] += 1
    edge['last_access'] = datetime.now()
```

## Traversal Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search
```python
def bfs_traverse(graph, start, max_depth=3):
    """Traverse graph breadth-first"""
    queue = [(start, 0)]
    visited = {start}
    results = []

    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.pop(0)
        results.append(node)

        if depth < max_depth:
            for neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(node):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))

    return results
```

### Depth-First Search
```python
def dfs_traverse(graph, start, visited=None):
    """Traverse graph depth-first"""
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()

    visited.add(start)
    results = [start]

    for neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(start):
        if neighbor not in visited:
            results.extend(dfs_traverse(graph, neighbor, visited))

    return results
```

## Optimization

### Memory Efficiency
- Use adjacency lists
- Implement lazy loading
- Cache frequent paths

### Query Performance
- Index key relationships
- Maintain traversal hints
- Implement path pruning

## Common Issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cycles | Maintain visited set |
| Memory leaks | Implement cleanup |
| Path explosion | Use max depth |
