# Documentation Style Guide

This style guide follows the **ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207** standard for software documentation.

## General Principles

* **Clarity** – Use simple language, avoid jargon where possible.
* **Consistency** – Follow the same heading hierarchy, terminology, and formatting throughout.
* **Traceability** – Every requirement, design decision, and test case should be traceable to a source (e.g., ISO clause, user story).
* **Accessibility** – Content must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA (see `accessibility.md`).

## Document Structure

All documentation lives under the `docs/` directory and uses the following top‑level sections:

1. **User Manual** – Guides for end‑users and operators.
2. **Technical Manual** – Architecture, deployment, and internal design.
3. **Development Manual** – Setup, contribution workflow, and coding standards.
4. **Onboarding Manual** – Introductory material for new team members.
5. **Agent‑Onboarding** – Specific guidance for building and deploying agents.
6. **Reference Materials** – Glossary, style guide, security classification, review log, metadata, changelog, traceability matrix.

Each section contains an `index.md` that links to its subsections.

## Formatting Conventions

* **Headings** – Use ATX style (`#`, `##`, `###`). Top‑level (`#`) is reserved for file titles.
* **Code blocks** – Use fenced code blocks with language identifier, e.g.:
  ```python
  def foo():
      pass
  ```
* **Tables** – Markdown tables for enumerations, classification, and traceability.
* **Diagrams** – PlantUML (`*.puml`) or Mermaid (`*.mmd`) files placed alongside the markdown that references them.
* **Metadata** – Every markdown file starts with a YAML front‑matter block (`---`) containing `title`, `author`, `date`, and `tags`.

## Review Process

All documentation changes must be recorded in `review-log.md` and undergo at least one peer review before merging to `master`.
