# Accessibility Statement

This documentation set conforms to **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards. All markdown files use semantic headings, sufficient contrast in generated HTML, and descriptive link text.

## How we ensure accessibility

* **Structure** – Proper heading hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`).
* **Alt text** – All images included in the docs (e.g., diagrams) must have descriptive `alt` attributes in the generated HTML.
* **Keyboard navigation** – The MkDocs theme used supports full keyboard navigation.
* **Screen reader friendly** – Content is written in clear, concise language; tables include headers.

If you encounter any accessibility barriers, please open an issue in the repository.
