# Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level roadmap for the Soma Fractal Memory project. For a more detailed breakdown of the engineering sprints and tasks, please refer to the [Architecture Roadmap](ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md).

## Near-Term Goals

*   **Production Readiness:** Complete the remaining tasks in the [Architecture Roadmap](ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md) to ensure the project is production-ready. This includes:
    *   Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Adding support for TLS and authentication.
    *   Improving observability with structured logging and tracing.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Benchmark the system to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
    *   Optimize the storage layer for improved throughput and latency.
*   **Feature Enhancements:**
    *   Implement a more sophisticated memory decay and retention policy.
    *   Add support for additional storage backends and vector stores.

## Long-Term Vision

*   **Cognitive Architecture:** Evolve the system into a full-fledged cognitive architecture, with support for advanced features such as:
    *   Automated knowledge graph construction.
    *   Causal inference.
    *   Goal-oriented reasoning.
*   **Multi-Modal Memory:** Extend the system to support multi-modal memories, including images, audio, and video.
*   **Decentralized Memory:** Explore the possibility of a decentralized memory system, where agents can share and collaborate on memories in a peer-to-peer fashion.
