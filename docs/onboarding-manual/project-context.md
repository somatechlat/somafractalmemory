# Project Context

SomaFractalMemory is a specialised memory manager designed for AI-driven agents. The 2025 rewrite focused the product on a single contract: `/memories` store, search, fetch, and delete. All graph exploration features were removed to simplify maintenance and improve reliability.

- **Mission**: Provide trustworthy long-term memory for AI agents and automation workflows.
- **Primary users**: Internal product squads, platform services, and select external partners.
- **Non-goals**: General-purpose graph databases or keyword-only search engines.
