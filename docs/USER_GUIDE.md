# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ addresses the most common questions users have when getting started with **SomaFractalMemory**.

## General

**Q: What is the difference between *episodic* and *semantic* memory?**
A: *Episodic* memory stores the payload exactly as‑provided and is retrieved by the exact coordinate key. *Semantic* memory also stores the payload but creates a vector embedding (via Milvus) that enables similarity search based on content.

**Q: Do I need Docker to run the system?**
A: Docker is required for the supporting services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Milvus). The API is a Django + Django Ninja service and can be run locally without Docker if you provide alternative back-ends.

## Authentication & Security

**Q: How is authentication handled?**
A: The API expects a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. For local development a static token (`devtoken`) is used. In production you should provision a secure token and rotate it regularly.

**Q: Can I run the API behind a TLS reverse proxy?**
A: Yes. The API does not terminate TLS itself; you can place an Nginx or Traefik proxy in front of it.

## Operations

**Q: How do I delete a memory?**
A: Use the `DELETE /memories/{coord}` endpoint. This removes the entry from the KV store, vector store, and graph store.

**Q: How can I bulk‑load many memories?**
A: The `POST /memories/bulk` endpoint accepts a JSON array of memory objects for efficient ingestion.

## Development

**Q: Where can I find the API OpenAPI schema?**
A: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:10101/openapi.json` when the server is running.

**Q: How do I run the test suite?**
A: Inside the virtual environment run `pytest -q`. Linting with `ruff check .` and type checking with `mypy somafractalmemory` are also recommended.

# Quick‑Start Guide

This guide shows the minimal steps to store and retrieve a memory using the HTTP API.

## 1. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose --profile core up -d
```

The API will be reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:10101`.

## 2. Set the dev token

```bash
export SOMA_API_TOKEN=devtoken
```

## 3. Store a memory

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10101/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOMA_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"coord":"1.0,2.0,3.0","payload":{"message":"Hello"},"memory_type":"semantic"}'
```

You should receive a `200` response with the stored memory ID.

## 4. Retrieve the memory by coordinate

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:10101/memories/1.0,2.0,3.0 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOMA_API_TOKEN"
```

## 5. Search by query

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10101/memories/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOMA_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Hello","top_k":5}'
```

The response contains the most similar memories.

# Features Overview

This document provides a high‑level overview of the capabilities offered by **SomaFractalMemory**.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Episodic Memory** | Store arbitrary JSON payloads indexed by a coordinate vector. Retrieval by exact coordinate.
| **Semantic Memory** | Store payloads with vector embeddings (via Milvus) enabling similarity search.
| **Graph Store** | Relationships between memories are captured in a NetworkX graph for traversals and reasoning.
| **Versioning** | Each memory version is retained, allowing rollback and audit trails.
| **Bulk Operations** | Batch insert and delete APIs for high‑throughput ingestion.
| **Health & Metrics** | `/healthz`, `/readyz` endpoints and Prometheus‑compatible metrics.
| **Extensible Provider Architecture** | Plug‑in new KV, vector, or graph back‑ends by implementing the provider interfaces.

## Non‑Functional Characteristics

* **Scalable** – Horizontal scaling via Docker Compose; each component can be replaced with a managed cloud service.
* **Secure** – Token‑based authentication, TLS termination can be added via a reverse proxy.
* **Observability** – Structured logging, OpenTelemetry traces (optional).
* **Compliance** – Documentation follows ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility.

# Installation Guide

This guide walks you through installing **SomaFractalMemory** on a local macOS or Linux development machine.

## Prerequisites

* Python **3.10+** (recommended via `pyenv` or system Python)
* Docker Desktop (Compose v2) – required for the PostgreSQL, Redis, and Milvus services.
* Git
* A POSIX‑compatible shell (`zsh` is the default on macOS).

## Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/somatechlat/somafractalmemory
   cd somafractalmemory
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the package and development extras**
   ```bash
   pip install -U pip
   pip install -e ".[api,dev]"
   ```

4. **Create and configure the environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   echo "SOMA_API_TOKEN=devtoken" >> .env   # local‑only token
   ```

5. **Start the supporting services**
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile core up -d
   ```
   This brings up PostgreSQL, Redis, Milvus, and the API.

6. **Verify the API is healthy**
   ```bash
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:10101/healthz
   ```
   You should see `true`.

7. **Run the test suite** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ```

You are now ready to interact with the API as described in the **Quick‑Start** guide.
