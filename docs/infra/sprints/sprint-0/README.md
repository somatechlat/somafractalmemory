# Sprint 0 — Readiness Gap Fixes

This folder stores evidence that the Sprint 0 acceptance criteria from `docs/ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md` have been satisfied.

## Deliverables
- ✅ `scripts/reset-sharedinfra-compose.sh` renamed and executable.
- ✅ Docker vs SomaStack parity notes documented (`docs/DEVELOPER_ENVIRONMENT.md`).
- ✅ Redis/Kafka/Postgres recovery steps captured in developer docs.
- ✅ Onboarding docs reference the SomaStack playbook.

## Evidence to Attach
- `reset-sharedinfra-compose.log`: terminal output from a full reset run.
- `compose-up-health.log`: combined output showing `make compose-up` + `make compose-health` succeeding post-reset.
- Any additional screenshots or structured notes describing issues encountered and resolutions.
